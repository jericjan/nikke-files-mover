# Nikke-Files-Mover 
- a program that helps you move NIKKE data between your phone and an emulator. It won't copy files that are already on the other device, which saves you time and space.
It also removes files on the outdated device that don't exist anymore on the updated device.
# How To Use:
- Turn on USB debugging on both devices.
- Run the main.py file.
- Follow the instructions on the screen. Only connect the correct device when the program tells you to.
